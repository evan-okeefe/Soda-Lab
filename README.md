# Bottles of Soda Lab

Directions:  Sailors love to sing songs, which are known as sea shanties. One of the best sea shanties is the song “99 bottles of soda on the wall.” It goes like this:


> 99 bottles of soda on the wall, 99 bottles of soda. You take one down,
> pass it around. 98 bottles of soda on the wall.
>
> 98 bottles of soda on the wall, 98 bottles of soda. You take one down,
> pass it around. 97 bottles of soda on the wall. … 1 bottle of soda on
> the wall, 1 bottle of soda. You take 1 down, pass it around. No more
> bottles of soda on the wall!



You start with 99 bottles and keep singing until you run out of soda! Although many sailors have made it through this song easily, it can be a bit excessive for the average landlubber. Hence, you need to make the computer sing the song by printing it to the output window.



## Requirements:

-  Your program must start with a commented header that includes the filename, your name, the date, the course, and a description of the program.

-  Your program should run as a loop with the variable numBottles and have as little repeated code as possible.

-  Your output must match the song precisely (spacing, plural/singular words, punctuation, ..etc.)

-   There shall be no “hard-coding” of numerical values (all numbers in System.out.println() must be variables).

## Challenges:



1. After every 5 sodas, make the computer ‘BURP!’ in the
   output window.

2. Let the user determine what number of bottles the
   song starts at.

3. Randomly take breaks in the middle of the song to sing
   happy birthday to your favorite pirate (Captain Jack, Long John
   Silver, or whoever else you like). Use abstraction and break your
   code up using methods!
